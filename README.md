## `about the project`

I had an exercise in Udemy course to make a simple clone of [patatap.com](https://patatap.com/), and I decided to make it in React.
In the tutorial they used Paper.js, but it wasn't that simple to do what I wanted to do using this library, so I switched to Konva and Spring to make animation.
The sounds are from Patatap and implemented with Howler.js.

### `code to show`

* Basic React syntax
* Styled Components syntax
* How to randomize stuff
* Using Konva
* Using react-spring
